# Scripts from my work at the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability (3cs)

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I wrote during my work at the Centre for Climate Change (3cs) at Ashoka University. These scripts cover various aspects of climate change research, data analysis, and geospatial processing. 

## Paper Reference

During my time at the Centre for Climate Change (3cs), I worked on a research project that resulted in the following paper:

**Evaluating methods to map burned area at 30-meter resolution in forests and agricultural areas of Central India** \[2022\]

## Scripts

- `indices_visualisation.R`: This script beautifully visualizes the indices created in Python, ENVI, or any output in the `.tiff` format using the `ggplot2` package in R.
- `raster_reprojection.py`: This script reprojects a raster file to the CRS of another selected file using the `rasterio` library in Python.
- ...
