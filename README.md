# Scripts from my geospatial work

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I wrote for geospatial tasks at different organisations. These scripts cover various aspects of climate change research, data analysis, and geospatial processing. 



## Scripts

- `gee-image-download.ipynb`: This script demonstrates how to download a satellite image from Google Earth Engine using python.
- `raster_reprojection.py`: This script reprojects a raster file to the CRS of another selected file using the `rasterio` library in Python.
- `spectral_indices_creation.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates how to create different spectral indices from a satellite image.
- `indices_visualisation.R`: This script beautifully visualizes the indices created in Python, ENVI, or any output in the `.tiff` format using the `ggplot2` package in R.

- `ML_workflow_BA`: This notebook demonstrates the full workflow for predicting bruned area over landsat image using `scikit-learn`
